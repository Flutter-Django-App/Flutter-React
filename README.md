### Flutter is a free photo sharing social network where people can upload photos and share them with their friends all around the world. 

### This project was inspired by Instagram's functionalities and features. We created this by using Django/Python as our back-end framework and React/JavaScript as our front-end framework. Our repositories were split into two, so that in the future, we can implement React Native as the front-end for a possible IOS/Android app.
